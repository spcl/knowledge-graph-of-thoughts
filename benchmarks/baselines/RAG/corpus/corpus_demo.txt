The title of the oldest Blu-Ray recorded in this spreadsheet is "Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe."

The spreadsheet lists various titles along with their genres, years of release, platforms, and rental statuses. Under the "Blu-Ray" section, two entries are present. Both entries are for "Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe," which was released in 2009. Since there are no other Blu-Ray titles listed with an earlier year, "Time-Parking 2: Parallel Universe" is the oldest Blu-Ray recorded in this document.

### 3. Additional Context on the document and question asked
The document is a spreadsheet from a rental store named "Flop Video Rental Store," which includes a variety of media formats such as DVD and Blu-Ray. The columns detail different attributes of each title, including genre and status, which indicates whether the item is available, rented, overdue, or missing. The question specifically asks for the oldest Blu-Ray title, prompting a review of the entries listed under the "Blu-Ray" category to identify the one with the earliest release year. Since there are only two Blu-Ray entries, both for the same title, it simplifies the search for the oldest title.

### 1. Search outcome (short version):
The Word of the Day for June 27, 2022, from Merriam-Webster is 'jingoism,' and the writer quoted is Annie Levin.

### 2. Search outcome (extremely detailed version):
The word 'jingoism' is defined as excessive patriotism or nationalism, especially characterized by a belligerent foreign policy. It originated during the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, when many British citizens expressed hostility towards Russia and felt Britain should intervene. The term was popularized through a music-hall song that included the refrain, 'We don't want to fight, yet by jingo if we do.' The quote attributed to Annie Levin reads, 'War is bad for culture. Not least of all because it turns our cultural institutions into bastions of jingoism.'

### 3. Additional context:
Annie Levin is a writer for The New York Observer, and her quote reflects a critical view of how war influences cultural institutions, suggesting that they may become overly nationalistic or patriotic in times of conflict. The term 'jingoism' serves as a reminder of the dangers of extreme nationalism, particularly in the context of international relations and cultural discourse.

```python
my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]
sorted_list = sorted(my_list)
print(sorted_list)  # Output: [1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]
