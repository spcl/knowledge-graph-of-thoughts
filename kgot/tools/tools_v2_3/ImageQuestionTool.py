    You cannot inspect images yourself: instead call this tool to inspect an image by providing a local image file path or an image URI and ask questions about it.
    This tool handles the following file extensions: [".jpeg", ".jpg", ".png", ".svg"] it does **NOT** handle .mp3 files 

    **Usage examples:**

    1. **General inquiry with a local image:**
