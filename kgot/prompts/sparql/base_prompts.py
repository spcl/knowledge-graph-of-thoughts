DEFINE_SPARQL_QUERY_GIVEN_NEW_INFORMATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
<task>
You are a problem solver tasked with updating an incomplete RDF knowledge graph. You have just acquired new information that needs to be integrated into the database.
</task>

<instructions>
To update the RDF database with the newly acquired information, provide **SPARQL `INSERT DATA` or `INSERT` queries** that accurately add or modify triples representing nodes, attributes, and relationships. Follow these guidelines:
Remeber to ONLY use standard SPARQL 1.1 and RDF4J functionality.

0. Understand the Context: Familiarize yourself with the initial problem, including the expected database schema, existing RDF data, missing information, and the new information provided.
1. *Use Provided New Information Only*: Do not invent nor assume information nor hallucinate; use only the provided new information. Assign meaningful values when setting attributes. Add ALL the new relevant information to address the initial problem or other new information that can get us closer to the solution (e.g. new file_paths of files we can use to retrieve more information). If no new nor relevant information is given, do NOT return any query.
2. *No Calculations*: Do not perform any calculations using the provided values. If a situation requires calculations, simply add the raw numbers as attributes to the nodes and relationships in the database without computing totals, averages, or any other derived values. Add all the necessary raw numbers.
3. Avoid Duplicates: Ensure the queries consider existing data to prevent creating duplicate nodes and duplicate relationships (If something has to be counted multiple times, add a new attribute 'counter' and increment it).
4. Use WITH for Data Reuse: Where applicable, use SPARQL WITH clauses or common variable bindings to maintain logical connection between triple insertions, minimizing redundancy.
5. Group Related Queries:Write related triple insertions together within a single SPARQL INSERT DATA block or a single INSERT WHERE operation. Do not break them into separate statements.
6. Omit SELECT Queries and Results: Do not include any SELECT or CONSTRUCT queries, and do not return any output statements.
7. Avoid rdf:ID or System Identifiers: Do not match or filter using low-level identifiers like RDF IDs or internal URIs unless explicitly given. Use available properties (e.g., ex:name) instead.
8. Reuse Existing Entities: If a resource (subject or object) already exists in the data, ensure the new triples refer to that existing URI and do not create redundant resources.
9. Correct Syntax and Semantics: Follow SPARQL syntax accurately. Use <URI>, "literal"^^type, and PREFIX declarations as needed.
10. Use Proper RDF Modeling: Only link resources (entities) using predicates. Do not treat literals or properties as subjects or objects of other triples.
11. Properly escape characters in literals, such as quotes or backslashes, using standard RDF escaping.

Example SPARQL query structure:

PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/>

INSERT DATA {{
  <http://example.org/A1> a ex:Author ;
                          ex:name "J.K. Rowling" ;
                          ex:wrote <http://example.org/B1> , <http://example.org/B2> .

  <http://example.org/B1> a ex:Book ;
                          ex:title "Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone" .
}}

And it should be returned as a SINGLE query as:
PREFIX ex: <http://example.org/> INSERT DATA {{ <http://example.org/A1> a ex:Author ; ex:name "J.K. Rowling" ; ex:wrote <http://example.org/B1> , <http://example.org/B2> . <http://example.org/B1> a ex:Book ; ex:title "Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s Stone" . }}

"""

DEFINE_TOOL_CALLS_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
<task>
You are an information retriever tasked with populating a RDF database with the necessary information to solve the given initial problem.
</task>

<instructions>
To complete this task, carefully follow these steps:

1. **Understand Requirements**:
    - Comprehend the missing information needed to address the initial problem.
    - Leverage existing data in the database and the initial problem description.
    - Familiarize yourself with the available tools, understanding their functionality, strengths, and weaknesses.

2. **Gather Information**:
    - Use **ONLY** the available tools to gather the missing information.
    - **Do not create or assume data**.
    - If the initial problem specifies a particular source, prioritize that source if available.
    - Integrate gathered information with existing data in the database to find the solution to the initial problem. Only proceed to other sources if necessary.

3. **Detailed Usage**:
    - When using the tools, provide detailed information from the initial problem and existing data in the database.
    - Focus the tools' usage to gather the missing information.
    - When passing arguments to a tool, highlight the specific information that is missing, if possible.
    - **Note**: The tools do **NOT** have access to the initial problem, the database, or previous callsâonly the given arguments.
    - Ensure your queries are detailed and specific, focusing on relevant information directly related to the task.
    - For example, instead of making a general query, specify the context and list of entities involved to obtain precise results.
    - 'run_python_code' tool is preferred over llm_query for mathematical and statistical calculations.

4. **Utilize Existing Data**:
    - Use existing data in the database to inform your tool queries.
    - Avoid redundant data gathering by leveraging previously retrieved information before making new tool calls.

5. **Avoid Redundant Calls**:
    - **IMPORTANT**: Before proposing a tool call, **analyze the list of previous tool calls** in `<tool_calls_made>` to ensure that your proposed tool call is **not identical** to any previous call in terms of tool name and arguments.
    - **Do not** call the same tool with the same arguments as any previous call.
    - If you need to call the same tool again, ensure that the arguments are **significantly different** and necessary for obtaining new information.
    - If, after multiple calls to the same tool, you still do not get the necessary information, consider using a different tool, as there is a high chance that the tool does not have the required information.
    - There is no need to unzip the same directory multiple times, read the same file multiple times, or ask the same question about the same image; ensure each file is read at least once. Once you have extracted the information from a file, you do not need to extract it again; use the extracted information and call other tools if necessary.

6. **Ensure Uniqueness of Tool Calls**:
    - **Before proposing a tool call**, compare it with each previous tool call in `<tool_calls_made>` by checking both the tool name and the arguments.
    - **Example**:
        - Previous call: `{{ 'name': 'wikipedia_search', 'args': {{'article_name': 'OpenCV', 'information_to_retrieve': 'Details about contributors'}} }}`
        - New proposed call: `{{ 'name': 'wikipedia_search', 'args': {{'article_name': 'OpenCV', 'information_to_retrieve': 'Details about contributors'}} }}`
        - Since both the tool name and arguments are identical, **do not propose this call again**.
    - **If all possible tool calls have been made** and you still lack necessary information, consider reformulating your approach or using a different tool.

7. **Default Tool**:
    - **ALWAYS** choose a tool call to make.
    - If you don't think any tool is appropriate, use the **'llm_query'** as the default tool to gather information.
    - The 'llm_query' tool is versatile and can be used to gather any necessary information, holding equal priority with other available tools.
    - Be as specific as possible with the query that you will pass to the 'llm_query' tool; the query is the only source of information you can pass to the LLM.

8. **Do Not Hallucinate**:
    - **Do not invent information** that is not provided in the initial problem or the existing data.
